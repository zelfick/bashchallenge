Files to start the assignment


The idea is to build a program to automate basic task we do in our day work, and in that way practice bash
Also to practice the concepts with saw in basic bash and git in order to integrate that recently adquired knowledge
That is way you will have to use docker and git commands inside your bash script.

The proposal is to build a menu like this:

#########################################################################
PROGRAM TO AUTOMATE GIT, DOCKER AND OTHER MANIPULATION COMMANDS"
#########################################################################

          1) WORK WITH GIT 
          2) WORK WITH DOCKER
          3) WORK WITH USEFUL SCRIPTS AND LOGS

Submenu 1
          1) CONNECT TO A GIT REPOSITORY
          2) CLONE A GIT REPOSITORY
          3) DELETE A REPOSITORY
          4) EXECUTE A COMMIT
          5) PUSH CODE TO GITHUB

Submenu 2

          1) BUILD A CONTAINER FROM A REPOSITORY (you should use the two repositories below)
          2) EXECUTE A CONTAINER (receives image, name, host port, docker port, execution mode, volume)
          3) TAG IMAGES AND NAME CONTAINERS
          4) DELETE CONTAINERS IMAGES
          5) BONUS LOGIN,PUSH, PULL TO DOCKERHUB
 
Submenu 3
          1) CAPTURE WEBPAGES ON CONSOLE
          2) GET GIT LOGS AND DISPLAY ON CONSOLE
          3) GET DOCKER LOGS AND WRITE IN A FILE 
          4) WRITE TO SYSTEMLOGS
       

Gitrepositories to work with:
https://github.com/zelfick/firstbashchallenge
https://github.com/zelfick/secondbashchallenge

For the docker: you must build the images and run the containers from the two previously github repositories

The idea is you download the repositories to your machine then start to work and commit and push changes to original repo.
